  abstract = {Most nations have experienced an internal armed conflict since 1960. Yet while civil war is central to many nations' development, it has stood at the periphery of economics research and teaching. The past decade has witnessed a long overdue explosion of research into war's causes and consequences. We summarize progress, identify weaknesses, and chart a path forward. Why war? Existing theory is provocative but incomplete, omitting advances in behavioral economics and making little progress in key areas, like why armed groups form and cohere, or how more than two armed sides compete. Empirical work finds that low per capita incomes and slow economic growth are both robustly linked to civil war. Yet there is little consensus on the most effective policies to avert conflicts or promote postwar recovery. Cross-country analysis of war will benefit from more attention to causal identification and stronger links to theory. We argue that micro-level analysis and case studies are also crucial to decipher war's causes, conduct, and consequences. We bring a growth theoretic approach to the study of conflict consequences to highlight areas for research, most of all the study of war's impact on institutions. We conclude with a plea for new and better data. ( JEL D72, D74, O17)},

By late 2019, the US had imposed tariffs on roughly 350 billion of Chinese imports, and China had retaliated on 100 billion US exports. Economists have used a diversity of data and methods to assess the impacts of the trade war on the US, China and other countries. This article reviews what we have learned to date from this work.},

First, we demonstrate that GPR episodically increases economic and financial uncertainty, with significant spikes during major geopolitical events. We then identify two primary transmission channels: the financial channel, where uncertainty and heightened risk aversion drive shifts in investment portfolios and capital flows, and the real economy channel, which impacts global trade, supply chains, and commodities. Using data from the past two to three decades, we provide graphical analyses that confirm the findings in the literature, emphasizing the episodic nature of GPR's impact. These insights underscore the need for policymakers to adopt flexible, event-specific strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of GPR on economic and financial systems.},

The review then identifies the two principal channels through which GPR affects macro-financial stability: the financial channel, operating through increased uncertainty and heightened risk aversion, leading to shifts in investment portfolio allocations and cross-border capital flows; and the real economy channel, impacting global trade, supply chains, and commodity markets.

Second, the geopolitics of international trade, especially recent work on coercion and fragmentation. Third, research on the geopolitics of international finance, which focuses on currency dominance and state-directed capital flows. Fourth, the literature on geopolitical risk and its spillovers to the domestic economy, e.g. on investments, credit, and inflation. Fifth, the economics of war, in particular research on trade and war and on military production. As geopolitical tensions grow, we expect the field to grow substantially in the coming years.},

(2) The interplay between forced migration, refugees and war. (3) The role of gender and war, with a special focus on sex ratios and conflict-related sexual violence. We conclude with an empirical investigation of the Russian war against Ukraine, including aforementioned historical determinants such as ethnic populations, historical political repression and voting outcomes.}
